When you get $100 credits and then when you use it like I created it yesterday I looked at it say hundred and I was playing you know some easy twos and I got a 125 I think at the end of the day when I claim more it's going to give me 200 so that's interesting I don't know why So when you get the economy there's some emails right it's gonna go to like 5 steps you have to put your credit card and then make sure that you know you have and if he multi factor communication enabled because otherwise if somebody log into your account is making your account they could do a lot of things right this is globally you know globally and then so I was at Amazon there is a company and some of them partner do you have a lot of content 4000 plus accounts right and then they have a portal which is the offshore team is working in India and then some of the leaks and then there 99th WE So I was on have I have machine learning monitor that's another reason it's safe on the cloud We have machine learning monitoring all the accounts each OK so we see Could you do it on Friday night this guy's gone they don't work anymore right so that Saturday morning Friday night or off Saturday night all the you know regions there's like a lot of easy to instances right easy to use the virtual machine you know right So we call them we email them nobody respond because yeah United States right the culture is we go right and then they leave the contact information OK so Monday morning came back They had 200,000 recessions those guys use the easy to instance to do money well so in any large big machines right of course right so that's what I'm saying here don't let do more effect authentication right because otherwise somebody is going to use your account You're gonna be crying I actually have a student he's taking another class I think a data big data then create database and then they don't like they don't leave it there for a long time and the outside unit and it's got a panic right so he's talking to Robert and Robert to ask me well you talk to Amazon see if they can give you a it's easy to get that because after that we accept you know you forget about yeah it's a traditional data center thinking it's so you got to be having these and also that's MFA right also the other thing is that you do cleanups after that each lab make sure you shut out you delete it alright I'm gonna show you OK so again cloud computing is that and so Doctor Dean our Dean is asking you to do that's very practical right now he said that you learn cloud computing can you do a website for me right in our students and teachers can access the webs right So what are you going to Yeah server like somewhere close to the region where the region is US right Yeah very good flowers yeah like N Virginia It's probably Oregon yeah right so so location right where do you put did the incident we don't mind physical I see they go cloud right and then hardware wise right how many Cpus with how much memory you know how much this whatever network that you're going to use and then the software right are you going to use a database OK right You know because it's going to be coding the student with cloud computing him I mean FTC 63 96 right yeah so you gotta be careful right through the information and the security who can access it and so those are things that I do right the doctor you know we want to make sure that he's heck right all right so step one is where do we put this in So as you can see that you know IW global infrastructure we have religions So he was talking about which region this time we probably do it in this too because we're close to them we can actually do I think right yeah Dallas I mean OK so Google actually recently opened a new region So Google copy is good right so so that's the first thing we're gonna decide right so if you go to the console I'm gonna I'm so I already logged in so so he so if you go to console bit of console the database when you come you can go there right and then you see that region right I am actually the default region for me is the United States OK which is N I mean US is 2 What is US E 2USD2 is a region right so we have Virginia as US is the one we have San Francisco CA as California as West Point and Oregon is right so we have 4 again there are four regions OK so that's the first thing we're going to say locations right OK location is going to be Oregon I mean OK right so uses and then so so so that's what we you know the first thing we choose is region so how do you choose the region worldwide you know you mentioned that it's going to close to a customer right I think he was complaints OK give yourself a point right so over the point okay what other things we're going to consider and you choose a region where do we put the computer right to the website well group of web yeah could you please go back to the previous slide I had a dog this one more slide we had so I noticed that wherever Amazon has their infrastructure it's all touristy destinations or tourist attractions like all the destinations in the particular country like popular touristy attraction so is there anything concentration of people yeah yeah customer OK right they do they do machine learning located where is in the next location the best LOC based on system data right what is machine learning look at historical final pattern predict the next one Very good very good question So the other thing is you have to consent in a legal violence right GDP You know you can right we don't know GDP The European Union said that the data cannot go to go outside the European Union so you have to stay but there's a legal requirements right so if you're working with a project with German you cannot put a data center in the United States OK you cannot choose the region in the United States you have to go to the European regions right and the other thing is service available so some data set there are regions you know some regions you don't have some like machine learning the generator some readers don't have it because it's old or it's new I don't know but that's something you have to consider but you don't want to do a machine learning project AI project but you want to find a region that you can do that right you know you choose that region and then you find out that doesn't have that service then it's a waste of time but and the next one is costs so the costs are very language Oh Haley different from you know capital right so the prices also man right so these are the things we consid and other than we did we have something called AZ availability zone right so the I'm going to show you a picture of this right so for example this region this region right this region is a region It has three a each is full data centers That's interesting OK so now the easy's right AZ is the ABCD right so the AZA and B dagging dependent meaning if we lost one AC it doesn't impact the other AZIM because they have independent power supplies they have independent you know whatever right so they are interrupted power supply and the network connection the network connections are very good hi babies OK but physically they are distinct the generators I saw Queen so you know if I lost the one OK so now thinking about the group right so you're .com the the E commerce the cattles in the hub right a lot of web service and web service right How design so that you know we have the high availability For example I put in I have three Azs how we will design the group of service they're going to be distributed most different Aziz but because when you create a virtual machine it's receiving in OK I'm going to show you right so now when you combine a lot of easy comes it's getting service into the group right you know from 10 to 11 to 12 right so when the ending is automatically distrib So there we I lost the one easy the other Arizona school book I'm going they're going to come up with the other Naz right so that's the Arizona concept right so if I say US is the 1D which means US is the one region The Arizona is deep because it's ABCD all right so that's that All right so that's right so when we create this server right let's come back here and let me show you right so I'm gonna create an instance right when you got right you are in a hail region i'm going to search for EC2 I have to type EC2 and it's going to be what is it why why it's called EC2 elastic cloud comput that E CC right easy square whatever right and then I'm going to launch an instance OK so given name I'm going to say the name is going to be Dean's but Dean SW in  OK see if it looks yeah dash OK let's see And then I'm going to choose how do we add a software right so that's the next thing OK so that's what we're going to do here move this away right So we're going to create a server in the cloud and then we're going to consider an when you buy a machine right from Amazon you're going to consider you know how many Cpus how much memory how much hard disk and the price of course right those are the things we consider right same thing with cloud So we're going to oh no I have to do my mouse here so that it's going to work So right so we're going to create OK so So what Amazon did is based on the usage they have created different instance right so for example it would and T3 These are the general purpose if I use a web server my purpose is doing a web server then I just using the general purpose right if I want to do machine learning and I'm going to use this So what they did is I think created some families OK so you know this kind of family like the G the P family the G family information right and if you want to do compute optimized for example I needed a lot of gaming things and it's easier see family and if I memory I see this computer right CPU right so memory optimized is going to be R RAM right so it's R6 R5 and storage is going to be I or D so these are the So what they did is they kept right they put them in different groups OK that's what they do right and for example like T3 large I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna pick up the out of it right if I say T 3 large T's effective it's general purpose surrey is a generation number and large is the size so T is three large M3 dot X large right C4 .2 X large right C is a family two is a generation and 2X large is the size but you see that you know T2 narrow T2 micro by all these different CPU's different narrow OK Why do we have virgins because they're software You know these are our budgets that's why I have our let me tell you the story right so at the beginning Amazon is online book Sinner right so at the beginning when people go online shopping in the middle of shopping I have some books my shopping cart disapp Why because they put it on the EC2 and they see to crushed OK so later on we change the they put the stick the shopping come to the stick right they put it into a database OK so now it's been like even my crush easy to crush the other easy to get pick up right so these are that's why we have versions right version Windows right version two is That's why we have OK so T2 micro T3 Micro is probably our best way because it's and then we don't need OK so these are the types OK and then let's handle it right software wise we need to have the operating system right is there any Windows or Unix or Mac OS right so we need to choose the operating system OK and then we give a name called Amazon Machine Image So what happened is OK not only the operating system but also so you could create an image right at the end of the day this is like the Windows or Linux these are images believe me these are images the operating system or this you know the the machine when you pick up the software it's an OK so when you create the machine right we have the hardware we choose the software and software is Amazon Christian image OK but usually we choose different operating right so So what I'm going to do is write coming back Dean told us to do that right so we we come back here then we're going to do right again so here so we do this name is called a Dean Web Server and the application in OS image We're going to choose Amazon Linux because it's a Linux operating system but it's it's it's cooked it's baked by enemies OK so AWS version of in the machine type is going to be Amazon Linux 2020 so that's yes MI that's AMI the the type is going to be T3 dot micro right you could choose and the price is right here right it's like 003 USD right and then if you because it's free tier electrical so it's free really it's free if you have a free tier account and it's you can change OK you can change from you know my my account is very limited so I don't have enough if you are in production if your company have the account you can choose different types C3G .2 X large et cetera et cetera for me it's for OK and then you can launch how many you can Don't do like a subject All right let's do it And now I'm going to talk about right so remember the you know we're new we're going to make sure that it's seen right so we're going to do the AMI we do the instance right skip that skip that skip that skip that we talk about security right so now security we talk about is can we talk about keeping right So what is it keeping So it's two they're pit OK we have public key we have pedicure so when we create the virtual machine we have the public install in the cloud all right you create a keypad instead and the public key is going to store it and I'm going to save my primary key in Microsoft right so when I go back to log into the machine I'm going to bring my private key Hey he seemed to sorry I changed your name right can I log in this is my product key and you look at your public key that's it just you know you have to look at your public key in doing the match see if it's but there's a mathematical end so that's the key So the public key PR is going the primary key PRS can Oh my wherever I am I mean I'm going to go from right so that's the keypad right and then the other thing is actually it's going to call the security now KPI is one line of defense OK the security group is another line of defense Alright So what does security group means security B means hey you know I'm going to only allow traffic to my EC2 machine in the cloud from their machine from their network For example I'm going to say hey I'm going to only allow right me you know the traffic to go to from only on the traffic from this fashion all right and I will show you how to do that right so like like this one like this one only it's going to specify where it can be allowed to come from and what kind of traffic All right so let's come back here and do that OK so keep here i'm going to create a new key pair right a new keypad and when I create a new keypair I have some choices right i'm going to name this as PP right yeah OK right and then I'm going to choose different algorithms and all right now PM for openness which means when I use open SSS to access the machine SSHS security when I use them to do it and I'm going to use the top PM otherwise if I use putty which is which is two I'm going to show you and right so the good thing is that I came from RPM I can change to keep it right so that now I already created so I could create a new Keyclass and then you can send it right i'm just going to cancel this now because I right any questions about keeping we good Yeah if you lose the keypad very good if you lose the keypad yeah you cannot do anything you have to you have to probably like recruit this That's why you keep the key I can give the keypad to you You can access that that's it's a yeah good question What point are you going to point two I remember you asking 3 OK and that's a good yeah so so that's a keypad yeah Mm-hmm Is there any way we can recovery so that's that and the next thing security is gonna be and security group right so I can create a new security group or use this existing group OK now if I create new group it says traffic again it's secure from anywhere That's not good right if I say from anywhere you see that zero 0000 that means OK now I explained that when I put but 0000 plus test zero it's going to be in which means anybody from the intern can which is not good right it's assecure so I'm going to say is I'm going to change it right so I'm going to change that into my IP right my IP OK my IP then it's going to be only this right so I'm only allowed this machine to go to the cloud and access easy to right but that's good right so now I'm going create a new one and actually I already created some just select the family this game which is nonstop in which it's going to be right I will show you right and then everything else is going to be good I that's it yeah so if you have private key but your machine destroyed then can you access like as you have is to the private key but your machine destroyed The machine is chewing destroyed like it's OK yeah so then the IP will not match then the IP will not match like can you how can you access with your private Commission is crushed and you cannot access You are selecting SSS from your machine only like yeah I mean this machine yeah so yeah it's crashed so can you access it with the private key but from another machine Yes yeah then no no no so two things right so one thing is the keypad the other thing is the private IP address right your your machine you have different IP address you cannot because it dictate only from this machine iPads unless your machine has the same iPad And that's possible because if that mission crashed you can take their pages and I sent to your machine and you are able to as long as the IP address match the keypad match two lines of got it good Right so we just create the machine right yes My my question is when select that one SSH for a specific IP address What happens in the case with  When you restart machine you are starting with EC 2 or this machine if you restart this machine and this machine is generic yes yes would you still be able to SSH okay this is a great question so I'm happy that I original Alright so it's going to change right but but look you know the IP address which I in my IP right is actually not the IP which is used for all the UTT because it's the Internet so within the UTD domain they are intern the DHCP is so this guy only have internal right but when it's go outside to the Internet to the cloud to the EC2 in the cloud it's gonna use the rout which is assigned to all the right yeah if you do NS look up you'll see these very good question so at the end of the day right your IP address when you say my IP from here when you're here it's gonna be because they're using so everybody anxiety I give you the keypad you can EC2 yes follow up question so let's see you wait for a mountain national cooperation in the public key to say only my Well the Africa machine can access the yeah so right so that's what you'd say is you set up I've done a network not only one So you use your company's networking range right for example when I'm just giving example done team Selena nil Not only one but I said what my IP is one Yep very good question one Alright OK so the next question is how do we so so Dean is we we partially finish the work right so we created a we created right and easy to OK so now what you're gonna do is how do we access that It's a little special right and what is the hardware instance T3 micro right and we have a key payer I KP and we have a security group only otherwise is it from this machine but it's a matter of fact from the from the UTD right from UTD terrible OK So what we're gonna do is we're gonna assist it using as I said right so we needed to download Honey is a to yeah download  So Patty is a two taste on Windows and I think This site is pretty want to do it right so you can download honey and then you can right so for example right which is good OK already did I'm going to open it up and you have my E Drive I you put the put this things right I I have the PM file right and I should delete this because I only saved my PM So when I download it I not only download the What's the purpose of halogen is going to use to convert the star PM file to the PPK so that I can use that right so I'm going to use and I'm going to load key which is gonna the PMI find the PMI and it's gonna my drive yet the PM clicked on the imported I'm going to save my private key into a dotted PPT right so I'm gonna say my KP i'm actually doing the conversion MyKp.Ppk and out I'll show you why we do that so then now we have the PPK file now we can use P so party when I click that it is an interface right so I'm going to log into my EC2 in the cloud so I need to find out what is the IP address of my EC2 right so I'm coming back here and I'm going to look at my machine and this is my machine it's up in one right and the public IP address is this copy this alright and I'm going to put it in here alright so there's a user there's a default user created when I created a machine it EC2 EC2 Dash That's the user I created all that machine and I'm going to add the IP address of the machine right so I'm going to go there and log in as EC2 user and I'm going to go to the connections go to SSH why secure shell and go to authentication go to credentials i'm going to bring my which is my private key Open it up right So what I'm doing I am saying I'm using puppy i'm going to bring my PPK the private key and I'm going to go to that EC2 instance in the cloud which is the public idea and log in as EC2 dash to use right OK and see what's going to happen right so I'm going to open that and it's going to say accept I know Steve you know it's the first time so when I bring my private key to the ECT the EC2 is going to look at it's a key pay That's why I bring my OK and I specify the public IP address and I'm logging as easy to use it so this is easy to use get the happiness right if I if I make it be good I'm logging as easy to use it OK so let me make it bigger and change settings Pierre's change 14 OK so you see that you see two dash using and the architectures now this is the internal OK the external IP is not showing up within the Princess but it's only to the outside world in those extended features so the EC2 machine has two app address what is the internal within the cloud and the other one is which is the one I used to get into because it's open announced to the Internet as the external IP questions Anyone you mentioned about the beauty of cloud computing so I was wondering how much of the concern is to talk around excessive use of ALTER and excessive combination excessive use of power data centers and what are these cloud Oh yeah to my environment it's Green 0 they're doing Google on CO2 so and unfortunately I don't know what they do Great question how do we do decrease the CO2 image that's what you like like the talk around the negative the downside Blood computing what are the practical issues they are doing to cushion It's a good question so I don't know the answer I said why you got a paint right and and I'm going to ask you to do some research and tell me next time right what they're doing to decrease the emission of I don't agree I don't have to do and then when you get the answer good news yeah because I don't know the answer And then when you got the honest I OK so that's what we do right that's what we have to create a machine and then the machine is in the cloud right congratulations you already create a machine in the cloud right now IP address and we have a key PM we can access them right so if I so good any other questions are you asked questions then you get points so from PM to PPK what kind of conversion it did oh very good question so that's the key gene software OK side down with the key I mean I did two things right and I'll show you I'll show you the software I've done right so so I download two things one called a penny when it's Patty Jim OK cutting is used to go to the machine right so that's the interface at the gym I showed you it's used it to convert PM to OK and when you have to create the key you can specify to dot PP I'm not sure if you you can directly you know save it as So if I use SSH I don't need the PPK file right I can use when you use SSH to the Linux machine right if you're from Windows this machine is a window that's why we use that P alright but if you make OS like some of you using mac OS right then you use the dot PM and the command to do that is i'm gonna write it down right so the command on your mac OS you're gonna open a terminal and you're gonna say SSH right easy This is not best man we don't use that so it's going to be SSH by EC 2 dash user right that's the user we have right And the public IP whatever it is and minus I the key whatever my KP right that's mykp.Pem because it's a all right that sounds good question very good question i'm happy that you know what did you end up in OK so keep going in and you get in a very who have not asked questions is there another software to access it besides Putty and what are the benefits of using Putty versus the other yeah very good question Patty got a point OK so party is straightforward it's a GUI right like the Mac you can do the SSH typically it's a command line versus a Google so so that's for the Linux machine If the EC2 is a window machine right when I when I pick up my operating system I could pick up a window machine right so if it's a window machine then it's girlfriend All right So what I'm going to do in a second sitting the window pocket and see how it there we go right definitely doing point any other questions who have not answered that question you have not so think of a question everybody else I'm already right 10 people 88 people already did that all right OK so let's do a window machine or is that alright so we come back here and we're going to go we're going to go here launch another instance right Alright and then the name is going to call it Window right Win one alright This time we're not going to use Linux so we're going to more a mice right more a mice OK so we're gonna use this ordering we're gonna use more Amis right so now we have Amazon we can have Windows right here right Do you see any windows Ah you can use a printer Windows 5 It was on the previous It was on the first one yeah yeah if you go back there is a Windows Let me do and then it's going to be OK and thank you and then you could do server you can do 25 space whatever we're gonna do so right so it's a window machine right and then type is gonna type is the same because it doesn't matter I have to choose the same hardware OK2 CPU memory and to keep your going to use the same keypad can I use the same keypad KP right and I'm going to select existing security group now I'm going to allow RDP right it's not SSH anymore because windows using RDP what is RDP remote desktop with a remote desktop to the machine That's why it's RDP and not anything right so it's going to be my right so it's an RDP and I'll show you what R everybody else is the same  Alright now we have this machine and we have the IP address which is different from the other one Alright so now this time we are going to use we're going to use RDP right so it's removed desktop right OK and I'm going to put the IP address here right i'm going to try to connect right now the thing is that how to use specific because it's gonna be using them in password right so more choices I use a different user what we do is I'm going to use Administrator but I don't know the right so how do you get password So what you do is you go back to that instance you see two this is the one by the window not as this is the first one yeah so this one is a is a is a windows right so this is a Windows and we connect right connect and then we have RDP client right and then we are get because it's used as an administrator get the password and then upload from the private key right which is the PM file in my which I saved earlier All right OK Now it's going to decrypt user password and visit us right So what we did is we really uploaded the private right and then we decide decrypt So if you think about it the the key PR for the windows is really the Illustrator and OK because the administrator was created when the machine was created right so that's the that's the difference right now you know how do we we got the password right so it's decipher so there's a lot of things right so I'm going to copy this copy this password and I'm going to come back here with the road P right administrative password and the domain is not going to Let's see let's see if it's gonna work Yes yeah I'm actually in that window machine it's logging into right it's doing the initial remove right so that's a window machine We're not intended because I mean really sorry right Any questions How do we decipher the password Yeah you have to upload right you have to go to the RDB client connection Now these things you're going to do it yourself right and I'm going fast That's right attention is right get you right now because otherwise and then when you go back what happened I cannot find it So you gotta pick Yeah and in the exam I how do you be saying All right I'm going to give you a keypad you do the all right so so that's the that's the Windows machine Let us again you sleeping What can I do to make you wake up then tell a joke somebody tell a joke Oh very sleepy tell joke about that So that's funny right that's funny So OK window operating system Now let me talk a little bit about I think that's how we talk about it you OK so I'm going to talk a little bit about security group right keeping how we talk about you know Windows and then it's and we talk about security now the Dean said he wants you to create a website right so you're going to install the web server application right on this EC2 by the Linux OK so the security then you want everybody on the world to access your website So what is your security recently you can allow right allow HTTP and HTTPS from all over That's one of these similar HTTP is 80 Do you know what I'm talking about it any idea like SSH is port 22 right So what happen So what happened there is OK so a web server you know the EC2 or whatever like for example you say W HTTP WWW what happened here right So what happened is on the Ww.google.com It's a machine The machine is watching all the polls OK22 is for SSH aged at 880 is for HTTP 443 is for H and many many others you know FTP my tail net right all the points up I think it's up to 10 these sports right It's watching over the ports see if it's anyone For example when newer processing HTTP it's HTTPS OK HTTPS .Www.google.com the the web server is watching it hey I got a connection from John right so they continue in you OK so so so I'm gonna have a child in process to take this OK in the chartered glasses is building a relationship connection to your brother right so when your brother there's a port on my side is focus OK so we have a connection you would type whatever you know search for whatever who is John or whatever right so such thing they give you the answer and then same time you and your brother WW dot HTTPS OK because my I am the demon of the website I'm running 24% watching it when I got a new connection from him right this this is Peter so Peter's web brother is coming here right so we have a connection new right so I'm going to have a child process to process yours so that's why it's using WWW dot google and never made this mix I have a child process hand to yours and the child to process hand in yours right and and and that's the point OK the traffic is different HTTP topic is different from HTTPS in different from SSH right so that's what SSH is 22 HTP is 80 HTTPS is closed OK so they are different protocols OK given portable map to different and I have when I create a security group earlier in the EC 2 I opened 22 for the first mission so the other guys can message I did not open anything else I did not open HTTP I did not open HTTPS That's a problem if I create a web server I'll show you next OK but you know so the security group is dict from where the trafficker can come from access to me I'm easy right and what kind of is that SSH traffic which is .22 or is it HTTPS which is they dictate two things Where it's coming from what kind of time that's any questions So two lines of defense keep here and security and keeping it that's what we talk about it OK So so any questions You had a point right yeah How who 2 I don't have a question but out of curiosity in the beginning of the session you mentioned something about doing cloud computing before M and machine learning so I was just thinking about like why so umm machine learning have I mentioned writing a book Machine Learning on Cloud then OK so that's a good question let me know what are your point first So so machine learning especially deep learning so let me talk about history So you you know the the first computer was invented in 1946 right at Stockport in the ACT right so couple of years later actually 1940 4055 OK10 profess Computer science profess They had a meeting in Dallas College Are you guys they propose the same the first time the concept of OK they're going to do a project AI project with 10 people in **** Their proposal you can go and find a proposal OK so very interesting and end up this 10 extended to 755 OK and two 2012 all right I mean it's to continue it the reason I'm saying I explained to you later and from 10 people to so many Yeah right it's crazy II was attending the Expo and we have an A I always making so so in the conference we estimate within the next five to 10 years 50% of the jobs will be replaced no no joking your generation is so lucky I mean you gotta be I quote right so you got to be very you know you gotta you better than AI you gonna generative Yeah you're serious right you know so many people right now I have many friends who lost jobs you couldn't find anymore because it because of AI right many companies say if a job can be done by AI we don't and believe me probably like sometime I don't know 20 years 15 years 10 years when somebody walked into their door right He looks like Professor Logan but he's a robot It's going to happen It's gonna but it looks like hey you know it's sometimes it's going to and at that time we don't know this is a personal role but they know each other They know each other who have watched a movie called HER Yeah right yeah at the end of the story that robot is having I phone you in with 600 questions because they know each other They know they know each other they come the the the AI know each other we don't and we don't know if right no it's pretty hard how do I tell right so no people are really worried about if AI is going to take over especially when robots right now physically they don't look around there right but once they work and work around when we are sleeping they are talking they are walking they are doing a lot of things and liquid their own language have you heard of like Nick Queen and their own church Their own church yeah just last week they have an AI touch just the physical building or well I guess the magazine but the building the community so so so only one company right all the other companies like Google open AI right see they're all trying to get the things smarter the model right smarter smarter only in therapy is doing some security So I think you missed the story I talked about I was talking to my last year my friend offered me to buy interruptic stock you know they're not IPO right but I can buy three IPO65 this year I wasn't I wasn OK because you know like things change a lot in 2025 my son went to year from year to was trying to Silicon Valley right california you know and then he had learned a lot I learned a lot right you know as I said I you know I need to change myself right my investment style has been pretty conservative and he said Daddy come on So so so anthropic right so anyway so that's why OK and the reason come back to your question is when you OK OK so continue sorry 2012 right so from 1955 over half a century we did not do big progress in AI all right we cannot even tell when you give a picture of something we could not even tell this is a dog or this is a cat was 85% in accuracy This thing changed in the year of 2012 and that's why I said you know 755 to the year of 12 the year 2012 is three things One is it's actually 20 like two years earlier 50D 50D is is a professor At that time I think it she was at she used to be in Princeton OK and then she developed her database called it Image Net Image The labeled 14 meeting pictures level This is a cat this is a dog this is a giraffe this is a house it's all live because only white label the database you can train the machine isn't it right without the database you cannot train the machine because you need to let the machine know hey this is a cat right and the machine is gonna look at all the pictures find the common things the patterns of course it's not that easy but you know that's just a right so that's one thing database data set OK two years earlier 2010 The other thing is computing GP Jason Wong right GPU was and initially it's a it's an image OK actually you could play games right I think it's 20 probably 2009 or something Angel NG who is a professor step between machine learning and he used the GPU to do machine learning right originally that took a week to do the model to change the model and then finished from CPU because he changed he used GPU to press CPU to run to train the model it take one day and he shared it with Jeff who is Jeff Hinton is the Nobel Prize winner of physics in the year of 20 He is the father of deep learning OK so Jeff Winton told everybody in the International Machine Learning Conference use G and that's why chainsaw kind of chilling because Jeff asked Jensen give me some GPU and then I'm going to the international Conference will go ahead That's really Jeff Clinton have all the machine learning community using GP that's called a computing power now we have data set we have computing power What's missing there's three things to do machine learning to do deep the other thing is algorithm alright so we have a data set we have computing power we have the algorithm it's a triangle Have you missing anything at right so the algorithm is new so it just happened that in 2012 all these things coming together and Jeff Hinton and his team join their competition and for the first time in human history we were able to detect an image with accuracy above it That was so exciting Baby just had her had her first child but when he when she heard that she flew overnight to either me to attend the conference and then it's it's the whole word because we are able to detect the image for the first time in human history using a computer with about 85 packets and then money comes in people comes in and then we are able to detect it with 90% 95% 99% now it's better than it's much better than our eyes you guys know right yeah they could detect the criminals right Yeah so that's why it's the deep learning and that's why we need a cloud computing because Gpus are expense you don't want to buy right you just wanted to use it and pay as you go right who knows t process it's from acronym so that's why Google right I told you that Google US in 2012 I mean 2017 attention to know you would need the paper right now last year Google come back There's a lot of good things You know they have TPU the reason actually Google did it very good last year google have data via Youtube search engine right and Google have computing power TPU GPU they have cloud So that's the why I said we should learn cloud computing first into machine learning on the cloud right does that answer your question thank you very much because you talked them you asked the question I talked about who 9 yards at your your contributing so I've decided to award all right yeah so whoever right you you're going to have two points when you do the search research come so so that's the thing right if somebody contributed significant to the classroom because I forget to talk about something right and your question because your question I was able to cool thing and I'm sure that's interesting right benefits to That's why And now it's your 10 minutes I have a question about so there's two projects in this class and you said you have till the end of the semester So what exactly are they going to be yeah so when is paper project when is hands on project A head-to-project i'm going to ask you to build a cloud on Google Cap right so that's going to become a little later because because we have to teach Google right and the other that's a handle now the paper project I'm gonna ask you use your right you can talk about anything for example when the time comes right we cannot do a robot from a human being What are we gonna do I that's just be creative why something scientific fiction right sweet Body problem that's why I want you guys to watch Three Body Problem and then Harry Potter It opened up We need OK in the air of air what do we need the ability of learning OK you gotta you learn yourself the ability of think right so many people saw the April 4 to the ground only knew didn't think about why right so you got the ability of in the ability of creation right that's why I want you to do something creat paper right pick up something very interesting you and you can also if you you you're very poor I mean you're very not a creative and you want to do something very traditional you can write a review for my book Why that's also fine i'm OK with that right and anybody you have to show me your Amazon review right but if you wanted to review how do I prove that you did right that's fine too and that's you know proving that you're read Don't say 0 this is a great Do some critics OK when I was at Amazon when we do performance review right we have to we have two parts have you missed one part it doesn't work your review is one part is what's a superpower about this What's the superpower the second is what are the things he can improve All right so two parts you can say this is a great book that's the best book I've ever read You gotta pick up something OK So what will you because of your benefits very good any other we good can can I ask about the machine learning like so right now the model like the improvement like yeah so it's fully depend on data right so in so there will be some saturation point that from the data it cannot learn more right And then then also people are using chat GBT and other model and they are thinking shaped by it so they also write like AI so at that point like both of them are like data which AI is learning It will not improve like it will prove no 0 that's a great question Now you got two points today all right now the question is asking so so so our data is already known the knowledge base right OK so let me ask you a question you know that Gemini gemini is able to the Olympic mathematical questions it used to be bronze it goes to server not gold How does it learn we have data how does it work right so the paper project you can do you can also tell me how does machine AI solve the mathematical problems right I mean it's you know the data is limited but this question are created right it's not you know I mean suppose you learn a lot I think if you read all these solutions all the things you probably can do but it's creative right there's no existing answer You gotta be creative so how does AI solve the Olymp load level math OK and relate to that I'm going to tell OK so we know that we have Olympic computation physics chemistry right biology a year ago actually 2020 we had the news encoded AI O and I happen to have a lunch with the chairman of the US community right and he introduced me to the China Jimmy all right so I visited him so now the AI if you have some brothers or sisters who you know quite interesting that's going to be good for their college applic I'm telling you AI right if you win some AI olymp right right so that's why I'm saying you know there are a lot of things like related to Indian online and and one thing that if you think about this you know this like you know the word mathematical problems right there are 100 if you solve one of them you got a meeting right you know have you got a website you system you know OK yeah difficult mathematical questions right so so when we human being if you if you do a search of the the Nobel prize winner like you know for physics and for chemistry a lot of time in history we human being have something or officer detained when I watch somet all of sudden they stole my I don't know if you guys understand like there's a guy called Tiny Town he's a mixed mutation so he was watching he's supposed to watch the Deus Friends again when we we go there could not find any ideas but something triggered a mass solution that he has been thinking for a long time Any kind of solution we cannot explain that we cannot teach AI That's the thing we're looking at if we can teach that inspiration acting things together that's gonna be crazy At the end of the day I want to say that AI is that is a tooth so there's no soul there's no love and no consciousness I mean you guys much harder so you know yeah so my opinion is like don't worry but I don't know I mean who does OK good question any other questions We all good All right so I think that's what we have right it's it's yeah so next time we're going to we're going to probably talk about storage and when we finish that there's Robert want me to shrink the Internet and focus on and it will probably do some secure cybersecurity and if possible AI stuff All right
